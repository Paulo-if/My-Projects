### _📍What is UnityCampi_
It is an application project conceived by students Paulo Otávio, Luis Felipe, and João Vitor from the Federal University of Jataí (UFJ). UnityCampi aims to connect the Riachuelo and Jatoba campuses, focusing on the students and workers of the institute itself. It consolidates the WhatsApp ride-sharing groups, promoted by the students themselves, into a single Android and iOS application.

In this app, academics and staff who have some means of transportation can offer rides to students who prefer not to take the public transportation provided by the university, known as "CAJ," a bus that is often overcrowded. Therefore, many students opt for these rides to avoid being crammed into the CAJ.
